//! [`document_write`](../document_write.rs) covers the other direction. This
//! covers the four shapes every read in the system resolves to: fetch by id,
//! fetch the whole collection, stream it rather than materialize it, and
//! resolve a foreign key by field value. None of them was measured, and the
//! difference between the second and the third is the difference between
//! holding one document and holding all of them.
//!
//! Swept by corpus size, because the point of the streaming row is that it
//! should not grow the way the materializing one does.
