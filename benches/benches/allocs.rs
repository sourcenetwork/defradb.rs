//! Allocations per operation on the paths a request actually walks.
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo bench -p benches --bench allocs
//! ```
//!
//! A count, not a rate: a busy host cannot move it, so this stays comparable
//! on a runner the load guard failed and a change in it is always a change in
//! the code. That makes it the cheapest early warning the suite has for a
//! clone that crept into a hot path, long before the wall clock notices.
//!
//! What is counted is every allocation the process made while performing the
//! operations, divided by how many there were. That includes whatever the
//! runtime allocated on the way, which is why the runtime here is
//! single-threaded and why the number is reported as "observed per operation"
//! rather than as the operation's own footprint. The comparison between runs
//! is the point; the absolute figure is a ceiling, not an attribution.
//!
//! Not a criterion target: an allocation count is exact on one execution, and
//! sampling it a thousand times would only measure the sampler.
