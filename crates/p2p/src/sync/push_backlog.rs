//! Bounded, per-peer-fair admission queue for outbound replicator pushes.
//!
//! Resource contract (#1099): outbound push work is admitted here as compact
//! job specs (head block + identifiers only — never expanded DAG payloads)
//! before any task exists to execute it. A fixed worker pool drains the queue,
//! so resident outbound state is bounded by the queue caps plus the worker
//! count, independent of total write arrival count:
//!
//! - `queued_items <= item_capacity`
//! - `queued_bytes <= max(byte_capacity, one job)` — a job larger than the
//!   byte cap is admitted only when the queue is empty so it cannot wedge.
//! - one peer holds at most `min(per_peer_active_cap, worker_count)` workers,
//!   and ready peers are served round-robin, so a nonresponsive peer cannot
//!   starve healthy peers.
//! - every admission has an explicit outcome; rejection is counted and the
//!   caller reports it to the persisted retry ladder. Nothing is silently
//!   dropped and no waiting task is allocated.
//!
//! Coalescing retains only the greatest `(priority, cid)` version for each
//! `(document, peer)`. Superseded active work may finish, but workers re-check
//! the version before transmission and before durable failure handoff, so it can
//! never recreate a stale retry obligation (#1102).
//!
//! Failed jobs leave volatile state immediately and are redriven only by the
//! durable scope-marker ladder.
