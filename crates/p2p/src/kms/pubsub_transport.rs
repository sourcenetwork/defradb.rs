//! Pubsub-gossip transport for KMS request/reply, generic over any
//! [`P2PTransport`] that supports raw gossip (`publish_raw` + `subscribe_raw`
//! + `register_pubsub_rpc_topic`).
//!
//! Wire-compatible with Go's `internal/kms/pubsub.go`, which layers the
//! `sourcenetwork/go-libp2p-pubsub-rpc` request/response protocol over
//! gossipsub:
//!
//! - The requester publishes a bare-CBOR `FetchEncryptionKeyRequest` on topic
//!   `"encryption"` and tracks it by `CIDv1(raw, sha256(request_bytes))`.
//! - The responder runs its handler and publishes the reply NOT on
//!   `"encryption"` but on the requester's per-peer sub-topic
//!   `"encryption/<requester_peer_id>/_response"`, wrapped in an
//!   `internalResponse` dag-cbor envelope `{ID, From, Data, Err}` where `Data`
//!   is the bare-CBOR `FetchEncryptionKeyReply` and `ID` echoes the request CID.
//! - The requester, subscribed to `"encryption/<self>/_response"`, decodes the
//!   envelope, correlates `ID` to the outstanding request, and unwraps the
//!   ECIES reply blocks. The AAD binds the requester's ephemeral pubkey and the
//!   responder's peer id — the latter taken from the verified gossip source of
//!   the `_response` message (Go's `resp.From`).
//!
//! This re-uses the Go-fixture-verified [`crate::pubsub_rpc`] primitive
//! (`Correlator` + envelope + topic naming + request-id derivation) rather than
//! a bespoke single-slot reply path, so concurrent fetches correlate correctly.
