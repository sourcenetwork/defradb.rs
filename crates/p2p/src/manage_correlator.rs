//! Management-channel request/reply correlation.
//!
//! Tracks in-flight management-channel message IDs → response channels so
//! inbound [`ManageReply`] and [`ManageQueryReply`] envelopes (delivered
//! asynchronously over the two-stream protocol) can be routed back to the
//! requester.
//!
//! Two independent correlators are provided:
//! - [`ManageCorrelator`] for mutating operations (ack/error reply via [`ManageReply`]).
//! - [`ManageQueryCorrelator`] for read-only query operations (typed reply via [`ManageQueryReply`]).
//!
//! Both mirror the SE query correlator ([`crate::se_correlator`]) exactly:
//! a shared `Arc<Mutex<RapidHashMap>>` + Drop-cleanup guard, keyed by message-ID `String`.
