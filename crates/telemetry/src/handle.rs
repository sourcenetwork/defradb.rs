//! Lifecycle handle returned by [`crate::init`].
//!
//! Go DefraDB never flushes provider state — buffered spans at SIGTERM are
//! lost. `TelemetryHandle` fixes that two ways: explicit [`shutdown`] for
//! callers that want a deterministic flush point, and a `Drop` impl that
//! flushes if the handle is dropped without one (panic, early return,
//! caller forgot, etc.).
//!
//! **Prefer explicit `shutdown`.** Drop is a safety net, not a primary path.
//! The opentelemetry-sdk 0.32 batch span processor spawns a dedicated OS
//! thread; `shutdown` joins it synchronously with up to a 5 s timeout. Dropping
//! a handle on a Tokio worker stalls that worker for the duration; dropping on
//! a current-thread runtime stalls the whole reactor. The Drop impl also wraps
//! the join in `catch_unwind` so a panicked batch thread can't propagate a
//! second panic during stack unwinding (which would abort the process).
//!
//! [`shutdown`]: TelemetryHandle::shutdown
