///
/// ScanNode can obtain documents in two ways:
/// 1. Pre-loaded via `with_docs()` - for testing, or when an earlier stage
///    (a docID lookup, an index scan) already produced the document set
/// 2. Streamed from a `DocFetcher` - `init()` opens a stream and each
///    `next()` pulls a single document from it
///
/// The streaming path is what keeps a `LIMIT` cheap: nothing below reads
/// further once the parent stops pulling, so the cost is proportional to the
/// documents actually consumed rather than to collection size.
