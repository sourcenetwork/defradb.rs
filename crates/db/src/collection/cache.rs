//! Transaction-scoped collection cache.
//!
//! This module provides a per-transaction cache for collection metadata,
//! matching the Go DefraDB pattern. Each transaction gets its own cache
//! that is populated lazily from the SystemStore.

/// - O(1) average-case lookups by collection name (RapidHashMap-backed)
/// - Lazy loading from SystemStore on cache miss
/// - Isolation between transactions (each txn has its own cache)
///
/// The cache is populated lazily - individual collections are loaded on
/// first access, and the full collection list is loaded when needed.
