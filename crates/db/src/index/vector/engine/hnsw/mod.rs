//! The HNSW engine: graph construction, layer descent, candidate heaps.
//!
//! Ported from Go's `internal/index/hnsw` (PR 5096), which is itself Malkov &
//! Yashunin, "Efficient and robust approximate nearest neighbor search using
//! Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs" (arXiv:1603.09320). Parameter
//! Parameter names, defaults, traversal order and link maintenance follow that
//! reference. Two things deliberately do not, both marked where they occur.
//! Neither is a compatibility break: a vector index is local state, and the two
//! implementations are not required to read each other's files, so the
//! reference is a starting point rather than a specification.
//!
//! - **A new node is stored before its back-links are added**, so a neighbor at
//!   capacity can weigh it against the links it already has. In the reference
//!   the node is not stored yet, reads as absent during that pruning, and loses
//!   the back-link it was just given (see [`insert`](Hnsw::insert)).
//! - **Distances stay `f64`**, where the reference narrows each to `f32`.
//!
//! The level assignment also differs, but not by choice: it comes from a
//! pseudo-random draw. The distribution is the reference's,
//! `floor(-ln(u) * ml)`, and the seed is the caller's either way. Node heights
//! are local state that nothing compares across runtimes.
//!
//! The engine holds no lock. The reference serializes writers with a mutex
//! because its store is a shared map; here every mutation runs inside a
//! transaction, which is what provides the single-writer discipline, and a
//! `Mutex` held across an `await` is exactly what this workspace lints against.
