//! IVF_FLAT: coarse lists of full-precision vectors.
//!
//! The same partitioning [`pq`](super::pq) uses, with nothing
//! compressed: a list holds the full vector rather than a product-quantized
//! code, so inside the probed lists the ranking is exactly
//! [`Flat`]'s. The only recall loss is a true neighbour sitting in an
//! unprobed list; there is no quantization error at all, which is what makes
//! `nprobe == nlist` byte-identical to `Flat`, ties included.
//!
//! A list entry is `encode_vector(&node.vector)`: `4 * dimensions` extra
//! bytes per document, alongside the node itself, so a probe is one
//! contiguous scan that yields id and vector together and feeds the SIMD
//! kernel directly, rather than a random read per candidate. That second copy
//! of the corpus is the cost this layout trades for the scan staying
//! sequential; said here rather than left as a disk-usage surprise.
//!
//! An index accepts writes from the first document and answers them exactly
//! by exhaustive scan, exactly as [`Flat`] does, because that is what it is
//! until it has enough vectors to fit centroids. Once the threshold is
//! reached it trains from a byte-bounded sample, writes centroids and
//! inverted lists, and answers from those instead.
