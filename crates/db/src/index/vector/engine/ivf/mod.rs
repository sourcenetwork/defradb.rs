//! The coarse quantizer IVF-PQ and IVF_FLAT both partition through: centroid
//! training over a byte-bounded sample, the inverted-list key layout, and
//! ranking centroids for probing. Neither is PQ-specific, so a fix here
//! covers both engines instead of two copies that can drift apart.
//!
//! What stays out: the residual pass and codebook training are IVF-PQ's own
//! (`pq::build`), and the trained-state marker is per-engine, because
//! IVF-PQ's carries `m` and IVF_FLAT's does not (see [`TrainedState`]).
