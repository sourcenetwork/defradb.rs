//! The collection head set: the tips of a branchable collection's DAG.
//!
//! A head is a stored block that nothing else names as a parent. Maintaining
//! that set by deleting a parent's head key when a child appears is the obvious
//! encoding and it is the one this module replaces: two writers appending
//! concurrently observe the same parent and both issue the same delete, which
//! is a write-write conflict the engine refuses at every isolation level. The
//! set stops forming siblings, which is a change to the data structure and not
//! to its speed.
//!
//! Here a writer only ever writes keys that name its own block: its head key,
//! and one `/cs/{collection}/{parent}/{child}` marker per parent. Two writers
//! therefore cannot write the same key, and the head set becomes a query: a
//! stored head key is live exactly when no marker names it.
//!
//! `proofs/tla/HeadSet.tla` checks both strategies, with
//! `MC_HeadSet_Red_EagerDelete.cfg` failing on the delete and
//! `MC_HeadSet_Green.cfg` passing on this one. `proofs/lean/HeadSet/Core.lean`
//! carries the algebra: `derived_writeSets_disjoint` for why nothing collides,
//! and `applyDerived_parents_not_head` for why the answer is unchanged.
//!
//! # Cost
//!
//! Markers are garbage once their parent's head key goes, which is inherent:
//! every conflict-free set carries tombstones. [`prune_superseded_heads`]
//! reclaims them in a transaction of its own, where the only thing it can
//! collide with is another prune. Left alone the headstore would grow one key
//! per mutation and each append would scan all of them, so the prune is not
//! optional on a device with a small memory budget.
