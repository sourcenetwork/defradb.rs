/// accumulation store, and without per-doc serialization their txns can race in
/// a way the underlying store's optimistic-conflict detection does not always
/// catch, dropping increments while the commit DAG still converges (#1021).

/// `Arc<DB>`), so local writes and merges contend on the same per-doc lock.
