//! WebAssembly fixed-width SIMD (`simd128`) tier.
//!
//! WebAssembly has no runtime feature detection: an engine that cannot run
//! these instructions rejects the module at validation. So the tier is gated on
//! `cfg(target_feature = "simd128")`, set for the whole build by
//! `-C target-feature=+simd128`, and the browser client falls back to the
//! scalar tier when that flag is absent.
//!
//! Baseline `simd128` has no fused multiply-add (that is the separate
//! relaxed-SIMD proposal), so `fmadd` is a multiply then an add.
