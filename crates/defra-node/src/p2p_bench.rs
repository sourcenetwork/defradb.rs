//! Two-node peer-to-peer replication benchmarks.
//!
//! These measure how long it takes a write on one [`EmbeddedNode`] to become readable on
//! a second [`EmbeddedNode`] in the same process, connected over Iroh with relays and
//! discovery disabled.
//!
//! They are written as `#[ignore]`d tests rather than as criterion benchmarks. Criterion
//! is built around many short, repeatable iterations of a pure function, whereas a single
//! iteration here has to build two nodes, establish a QUIC connection and wait for
//! network convergence. Criterion's sampling would spend most of its time on node
//! construction, and its statistics would describe that rather than replication. A plain
//! test that runs each size once and prints the spans it measured is both cheaper and
//! more honest.
//!
//! Run with:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test -p defra-node --features p2p p2p_bench -- --ignored --nocapture
