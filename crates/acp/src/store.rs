// DEFRALEVEL(S10): Persistent impl stops opening/committing its own txns; hands tuple keys/values to regolith traits
/// Trait for storing and querying relation tuples.
///
/// This abstraction allows different storage backends to be used
/// (in-memory for testing, regolith for production, etc.)
///
/// # Security: Input Validation
///
/// **CRITICAL**: Implementations MUST validate all string inputs (collection_id, doc_id,
/// relation) to prevent path traversal attacks. Use [`RelationTuple::validate_prefix`]
/// or [`RelationTuple::validate_relation_prefix`] before constructing storage keys.
///
/// Inputs containing path separators (`/` or `\`) MUST be rejected with an error.
/// Never construct storage keys from unvalidated user input.
///
/// # Security: Error Handling
///
/// All operations that check permissions MUST follow a fail-fast pattern:
/// - On success: return the actual result
/// - On error: propagate the error (do NOT silently convert to "access denied")
///
/// Callers receiving an error MUST:
/// 1. Deny the requested operation (fail-closed behavior)
/// 2. Propagate the actual error to enable debugging and monitoring
/// 3. Log the error for audit purposes
///
/// This approach maintains security (operation is denied) while providing
/// actionable error information. Silently converting errors to "permission denied"
/// masks infrastructure failures and makes debugging impossible.
