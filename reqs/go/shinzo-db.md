# `go.shinzo.merge`: Merging replicated documents

- **Parents:** ["go.shinzo"]

`DB.Merge(event)` merges one replicated head; `DB.MergeBatchWithTxn(events)` merges many and returns one outcome per event, in the caller's order: `MergeCommitted` (stored), `MergeRejected` (refused by the retention rule) or `MergeDropped` (not stored). Callers relay only committed events onward.

# `go.shinzo.block_owner`: Which documents own a block

- **Parents:** ["go.shinzo"]

Each block records the DocIDs that own it. Field blocks are content-addressed and carry no document identity, so ownership is a set.
