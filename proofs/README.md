# Formal methods for defradb.rs

Machine-checked models of defradb.rs's correctness-critical protocols. Two tools,
split by the kind of obligation each is good at:

| Dir | Tool | Proves | Entry |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`tla/`](tla/) | TLA+ / TLC | **temporal / distributed / concurrent** properties — convergence, "eventually merges", safety under adversarial interleavings | [`tla/README.md`](tla/README.md) |
| [`lean/`](lean/) | Lean 4 | **functional / algebraic** properties — CRDT merge laws (commutativity, associativity, idempotence), order-independence | [`lean/README.md`](lean/README.md) |

Some results need both. **DAG convergence = (TLA+: every node receives every delta
under eventual connectivity) × (Lean: applying deltas in any order yields the same
state).** Neither half alone is convergence.

## Coverage map

Status of the effort across the 40-crate surface, from the per-crate survey in
[`survey/`](survey/) (full index, incl. out-of-scope rationale, in
[`survey/INDEX.md`](survey/INDEX.md)). Of 34 crates, **12 are model-worthy**; the other 22
are plumbing covered by integration tests / Go-FFI parity / unit tests. The point of this
section is the **diff**: what is proven vs. the accepted gap.

### Modeled — 22 families (proven)
| Family | Tool | Crates it covers |
|---|---|---|
| B3 filtered replication | TLA+ | p2p, db-merge |
| DAG convergence (partition / eviction / restart) | TLA+ | p2p, db-merge, blockstore |
| CRDT merge laws | Lean | crdt, defra-core |
| Replicator lifecycle (no-loss / resume) | TLA+ | p2p, db-merge, embedded |
| Sync ownership transfer (head hint / receiver pull) | TLA+ | p2p, db-merge, storage, embedded |
| Multi-instance claim | TLA+ | gents |
| Block integrity / signatures | TLA+ | db-merge, defra-core, blockstore |
| KMS key distribution | TLA+ | kms, db-merge |
| Encrypted LWW restart/replay | TLA+ + existing LWW Lean law | kms, p2p, db-merge, crdt |
| Management-channel auth (NAC gate) | TLA+ | http, db-nac, pg-compat |
| ACP soundness + revocation + dual-path commits | TLA+ & Lean | acp, zanzibar, vera, query, db |
| Storage SSI serializability (point + range/scan carve-out) | TLA+ | storage |
| P2P explicit-replay capability gate | TLA+ | p2p |
| NAC lifecycle privilege-escalation | TLA+ | acp, db-nac |
| Transaction & merge-queue concurrency | TLA+ | db, db-merge |
| Document materialization status convergence | TLA+ & Lean | db-merge, crdt, db |
| JWT issuer / algorithm binding | TLA+ | identity |
| CID content-addressing determinism + Block canonicalization | Lean | defra-core |
| Deferred-ACP overlay consistency | TLA+ | query |
| Order-preserving key encoding | Lean | storage |
| Index-maintenance consistency | Lean + TLA+ | db-index, db-merge |
| Concurrent collection-head transitions | TLA+ & Lean | db-block-builder, storage |

### Backlog — want to model: **none**
**The medium-and-up correctness surface is fully modeled.** All 2 high + 11 medium backlog
items from the 40-crate survey are now in *Modeled* above (built across three
builder→verifier batches, each integrator-verified). The remaining work is the explicitly
deferred low-priority Lean-lemma appendix below; new modelable surfaces would come from a
re-survey as the code evolves.

### Deferred — Lean-lemma appendix (13 low)
Low-risk hardening lemmas parked for later: index-extraction determinism, cartesian-product
laws, LWW tie-break total order, storage encode round-trip, EncryptedStore key-binding,
capability rate-limiter fairness, Merkle batch-root determinism, DocID parse round-trip,
token clock-skew validity, DID-derivation determinism, schema update-immutability,
single-active-version invariant, blockstore cache↔storage coherence. (Full rows: `survey/INDEX.md` §2.)

### Out of scope — 28 crates
Plumbing/glue with no novel modelable invariant; one-line rationale per crate in
`survey/INDEX.md` §3 (cli, ffi, wasm, http-transport, storage-encoding-glue, …).

## Build / run everything

Prereqs: **Java 11+** (TLC) and **Lean via elan** (`lean-toolchain` pins the version).

```bash
# everything — TLA+ red/green oracle + Lean build, single exit code:
proofs/verify-all.sh

# or each half on its own:
cd proofs/tla && ./run-all.sh   # all TLA+ models (red+green oracle, non-zero on any mismatch)
cd proofs/lean && lake build    # all Lean proofs (builds clean, zero `sorry`)
```

`proofs/tla/tools/tla2tools.jar` is git-ignored; the wrapper re-downloads it if missing.
It pins the stable TLC 1.7.4 release by SHA-256. The upstream 1.8.0 asset is a
rolling pre-release and is intentionally not used for a reproducible gate.

## Conformance — binding the models to the real binary

The models prove properties of *abstractions*. The `conformance` crate (rooted
here in `proofs/`, alongside `tla/` and `lean/`) keeps them honest against the
shipped code, on two axes matching the two tools:

| Axis | What it checks | Needs a binary? | Entry |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Lean (auto)** | `lean/Conformance.lean` emits a JSON contract (vocabularies derived from the Lean models); the live Rust types are asserted to still match — anti-drift | no | `tests/lean_conformance.rs` |
| **TLA (behavioral)** | each family's invariant is driven against the **running DefraDB binary** via the backbone `defra-harness` | yes | `tests/tla_conformance.rs` |

[`src/registry.rs`] (`PROPERTIES`) is the spine: every *Modeled* family above maps
to its headline invariant, source anchor, the model that proves it, and its
binding tier (`Behavioral` / `Contract` / `Boundary`). `Boundary` marks what is
*assumed*, never asserted (crypto, eventual connectivity, bounded-N, foreign
substrate) — so a green run never reads as "this was proven against the
artifact." `matrix::every_modeled_family_is_bound` fails if a model lands without
a binding.

### Realized status — all 21 families bound

**19 behavioral tests** (driven against fresh `target/debug/defra`, each break-tested
for non-vacuity), **2 Lean-axis contract bindings**, **7 honest Boundaries** (one,
Transaction & merge-queue concurrency, is now both — a Behavioral no-loss/no-double-apply
storm leg plus a Boundary internal-serialization leg). One
of these (`partition::convergence_concurrent_same_doc_writes_merge`) found a real
Rust-specific CRDT convergence bug — divergent materialization on identical DAGs
after a restart — which is now **fixed** in `crates/db (merge)/.../lww.rs`
(`seed_lww_from_existing_doc` re-seeds the datastore LWW from the authoritative
headstore); go↔go vs rust↔rust parity (`parity.rs`) localized it to Rust.

| Family | Binding | Where |
|---|---|---|
| B3 filtered replication | Behavioral | `replication.rs` |
| DAG convergence | Behavioral | `replication.rs` (live-forward) + `partition.rs` (partition heal; concurrent same-doc merge — the bug it found+fixed) |
| Replicator lifecycle | Behavioral | `replicator_lifecycle.rs` (backfill no-loss + resume across node restart) |
| Sync ownership transfer | Boundary + external integration | deterministic full-DAG/head-hint A/B fence; `p2p_admission_restart`; marker migration/storage tests; mixed Go/Rust PushLog fixture. These run in repository CI, not this conformance binary's `tests/behavioral/` harness. |
| ACP soundness + revocation + commits | Behavioral + Contract | `acp.rs`; `RelationExpression` vocab |
| Storage SSI serializability | Behavioral | `ssi.rs` (real `409 Conflict` on write-skew) |
| Management-channel auth (NAC gate) | Behavioral | `nac.rs` |
| NAC lifecycle priv-escalation | Behavioral | `nac_lifecycle.rs` |
| Transaction & merge-queue concurrency | Behavioral + Boundary | `partition::{convergence_concurrent_pncounter_signed_deltas_sum,convergence_restart_pncounter_signed_deltas_sum,convergence_concurrent_pncounter_same_doc_merge_storm}` (PNCounter exact signed sum across live, restart, and storm); `partition::convergence_concurrent_same_doc_merge_storm` (no-loss/no-double-apply exact-sum oracle); `partition::{convergence_concurrent_mixed_lww_and_counter_fields_merge,convergence_restart_mixed_lww_and_counter_fields_merge,convergence_mixed_lww_and_counter_3node_full_mesh}` (mixed Counter×LWW exact-state); `MC_MixedFieldMaterialization_{Red_WholeDoc,Green}`; the internal "≤1 worker in the critical section" + txn-registry sweep stay Boundary |
| Document materialization status convergence | Behavioral | `partition::convergence_delete_update_race_preserves_tombstone`; `MC_DocumentMaterialization_{Red_Overwrite,Green}`; `DefraConvergence.DocumentMaterialization` |
| Deferred-ACP overlay | Behavioral | `deferred_acp.rs` (txn-local gating) |
| CID determinism | Behavioral | `cid.rs` |
| Index-maintenance | Behavioral | `index.rs` (single-node create/update/delete + indexed LWW restart/merge reconciliation); `MC_IndexReconciliation_{Red_SaveOnly,Green}` |
| KMS key distribution | Behavioral | `kms.rs` (node0 denies the DEK to unauthorized node1) |
| Encrypted LWW restart/replay | Behavioral + Boundary | `partition::convergence_encrypted_lww_restart_merge` binds the decrypted LWW winner after a restart-induced partition; filtered replication binds encrypted-field preservation. Durable acknowledgement-backed retry through a receiver restart remains Boundary; `MC_EncryptedLwwReplay_{Green,Red_*}`; reuses `PriorityReconcile.lwwCM` |
| CRDT merge laws | Contract | `MergeResult` vocab; `DefraConvergence.MixedField` product proof; `MixedFieldMaterialization.tla` |
| Multi-instance claim | Boundary | gents substrate, not this binary |
| Block integrity / signatures | Boundary | needs adversarial peer; Rust verify mandatory |
| P2P capability replay gate | Boundary | P2P-wire internal |
| JWT issuer / algorithm binding | Boundary | DID-binding via `acp.rs`; forge unreachable via CLI |
| Order-preserving key encoding | Boundary | ordered query may sort in memory; consts `pub(crate)` |

```bash
proofs/verify-all.sh                 # TLA + Lean + conformance (behavioral if binary present)
cargo build -p cli                   # produce fresh target/debug/defra
cargo test -p conformance            # Lean axis + behavioral; DEFRA_CONFORMANCE_BINARY overrides target
```

## Conventions (follow these in new slices)

- **One model family per concern.** Each family = a base spec (`tla/<Family>.tla`) plus
  thin scenario wrappers (`tla/MC_<Family>_*.tla` + `.cfg`) that `EXTENDS` it. Lean
  mirrors this with a barrel module + focused submodules.
- **Red/green TDD-for-models.** Every claim has a config the *buggy* policy violates (a
  TLC counterexample) and a config where the fix holds. A property that only ever passes
  green proves little.
- **Naming:** invariants/safety `INV_*`; liveness as `<>[]...` properties; scenario
  wrappers `MC_<Family>_<Case>`.
- **Source-anchored.** Every family has a `<Family>_DESIGN.md` grounding the abstraction
  in specific defradb.rs / gents source modules (file:line). Model the real code
  paths, not an abstraction in a vacuum.
- **Lean:** mathlib-free, toolchain pinned, **no `sorry`/`admit`**, and `#print axioms`
  status recorded in `lean/README.md`.

## Boundaries — what is proven vs assumed vs out of scope

Read this before trusting a verdict; it states the model's honest reach.

- **Bounded instances.** TLC runs at small N (2–3 nodes, ≤~6 blocks). These are the
  *minimal witnessing shapes* for each property; conclusions are structural (a guard on a
  fetch, a datum on a block), not quantity-sensitive — but this is exhaustive over the
  bound, not a proof for all deployments.
- **Environment assumptions (encoded, not proven):** `ProviderAvailable` (a fetch needs a
  reachable holder of the block); **eventual connectivity** + fair head rediscovery for
  the convergence liveness results; weak fairness on protocol actions.
- **Crypto boundary (KMS):** ECIES is abstracted — a node can use an envelope iff it is
  the intended recipient. Real ECIES/IND-CCA security is assumed, not modeled.
- **Float counter divergence (proven, real):** IEEE-754 addition is not associative, so
  float counters are NOT order-independent — proven by `float_add_not_assoc` in
  `lean/DefraConvergence/LocalState.lean`. The 2026-06-03 model→code audit confirmed both
  Go and Rust ship `Float32/64` counters with raw `+` and no mitigation: a real latent
  replica divergence (fix is a Go-parity-constrained product decision, tracked separately).
- **Excluded by design:** key rotation (a node revoked *after* already holding a key is
  out of scope). Model B's `INV_DagComplete` is deliberately relaxed (see `tla/README.md`).
- **Audit outcomes (2026-06-03):** model→code audit of all 9 families confirmed the GREEN
  claims hold in Go+Rust, and surfaced real Go-side gaps the models predicted — `_commits`
  is ACP-ungated in Go (Rust gates it; a known DefraDB limitation), and Go's P2P block
  signature verification is optional with an unverified author/creator field (Rust is
  hardened: mandatory verify + author-binding). See the slice `*_DESIGN.md` for details.
- **Model ≠ code.** These prove properties of the *models*. They are anchored to source by
  the `*_DESIGN.md` docs and bound to the implementation by the `conformance` crate (see
  *Conformance* above) — the Lean axis asserts model vocabularies against live Rust types,
  the TLA axis drives the selected DefraDB binary. What conformance does **not** reach is marked
  `Boundary` in the registry (crypto, eventual connectivity, bounded-N, the gents
  claim substrate): assumed, never asserted against the artifact.
