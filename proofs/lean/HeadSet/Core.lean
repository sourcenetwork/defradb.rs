# HeadSet_DESIGN: concurrent collection-head transitions (db-block-builder)

Mathlib-free Lean model of the **head-set transition** DefraDB performs when it
appends a block to a collection's DAG, and of why the transition as written
cannot be run concurrently on regolith.

The companion TLA+ model (`proofs/tla/HeadSet.tla`) checks the temporal story:
two concurrent writers, one of which aborts under the current strategy. This
file carries the algebra the temporal model rests on, and in particular the two
facts a reader should not have to take on trust:

* two distinct writers have **disjoint write sets** under the derived strategy
  and **overlapping** ones under eager delete (`derived_writeSets_disjoint`,
  `eager_writeSets_overlap`). The second is the non-vacuity result: it is what
  makes the first worth having; and
* the derived strategy reaches the same head set by a different route, which is
  what makes it a refactor rather than a redefinition: appending a block makes
  it a head (`applyDerived_is_head`) and un-heads every parent it named
  (`applyDerived_parents_not_head`), which is exactly what the delete achieved.

## The exact mechanism modeled

`write_collection_block` (Rust anchor below) used to do:

  1. scan the collection's head prefix, collecting `col_heads` and
     `old_head_keys`;
  2. build a block whose parents are exactly `col_heads`;
  3. `set` the new block's head key;
  4. `delete` every key in `old_head_keys`.

Step 4 is the subject. Two transactions that scanned before either committed
both hold the same `old_head_keys`, so both issue the same delete. regolith
validates a transaction's write set at commit under every isolation level, so
the second transaction is refused.

The store this replaced had an explicit carve-out for the case, an
`IterOptions::with_commutative_set` flag its conflict tracker honoured, which
is why the behaviour changed rather than merely regressing in speed. The flag
is gone: regolith cannot honour it, and one that silently does nothing is a
promise of serializability semantics nothing keeps.

The derived strategy keeps steps 1 to 3 and drops step 4. In its place a writer
records, for each parent it observed, a marker naming **itself** as the block
that superseded that parent. Every key a writer writes is then a function of its
own block id, so no two writers can collide. The head set stops being maintained
and starts being computed: a stored block is a head exactly when nothing
supersedes it.

## Source anchors

The derived strategy is what the tree implements; the eager one is kept here
only so the model can show what it costs.

Rust (`crates/db`, this worktree):
* `src/block/heads.rs` `live_collection_heads` is `derivedHeads`. It walks the
  head prefix and the marker prefix together rather than testing each head, so
  the query is one pass over each range and holds neither.
* `src/block/heads.rs` `record_supersedes` is the `supersedes` half of
  `applyDerived`, and `src/block/builder/collection.rs:89-92` writes the head
  key, which is the other half.
* `src/block/builder/collection.rs:19` reads the heads, and `:46`
  `Block::new(payload, col_heads, links)` records them as the block's parents.
  Modeled by `Block.parents`, the relation the derived strategy reads instead
  of re-deriving by deletion.
* `src/block/heads.rs` `prune_superseded_heads` is `applyPrune`. It deletes a
  head key and the markers against it in one transaction, which is what
  `prune_markersOnly_resurrects` says it must.
* `src/merge/merge_handler/collection.rs` applies the same transition to a
  replicated block, so two peers pushing siblings do not collide either.

The eager loop the model proves defective is gone from the tree. Its shape is
preserved in `eagerWriteSet` and in
`proofs/tla/MC_HeadSet_Red_EagerDelete.cfg`.

Storage (`crates/storage`, this worktree):
* `src/corekv/types.rs` no longer carries `IterOptions::commutative_set`. It
  was a flag the removed backends honoured and regolith did not, and once
  nothing set it a flag promising overlap that no backend granted was worse
  than no flag. regolith's `RepeatableRead` level now carries the same intent for
  every scan of the store, so the flag is not coming back. It is quoted below
  as history, not as an anchor.
* `src/backends/regolith/transaction.rs` `RegolithTxn::commit` maps
  `TransactionError::Conflict` to `Error::TxnConflict`. regolith validates the
  write set at every isolation level, which is why relaxing isolation does not
  help with a write-write overlap. `Conflict` is therefore modeled with no
  level parameter. The read side is settled outside this file: the store runs
  at `RepeatableRead` (`src/backends/regolith/config.rs`), where a scan is recorded
  per stretch and never per key, so reclamation deleting a key the head scan
  walked is not a conflict. `proofs/tla/HeadSet.tla` carries that as the
  `ScanReads` knob, red under `PerKey`.

## What is the proof's content (why it is NOT vacuous)

`applyDerived_parents_not_head` is the load-bearing result and it is not true by
construction: the two strategies reach the head set by different means, one by
removing a key and one by adding a relation that a query subtracts. They agree
only because a writer supersedes exactly the parents it recorded, which is
`supersedes_iff_parent`, and the proof goes through that lemma.

`applyDerived_is_head` carries its hypotheses honestly rather than assuming them
away: a block that named itself as a parent, or a store that already held a
marker against it, would not read back as a head, and those are stated as
`hself` and `hfresh` instead of being quietly excluded.

`eager_writeSets_overlap` is stated so the model cannot be read as proving
something about a strategy nobody uses. It exhibits the collision concretely:
given two writers that observed a common head, the intersection of their write
sets is inhabited. If someone "fixes" the conflict by changing `eagerWriteSet`
without changing what the code does, this theorem stops holding and says so.

/-- **The fix.** Two writers with distinct block ids never write the same key,

at every level.

/-! ## Reclamation

The derived strategy stops deleting, so a superseded head key stays until
something sweeps it. Without the sweep the headstore grows one key per mutation
and every append scans all of them, which is the cost the design actually has to
answer for on a small device.

The sweep is safe for a reason worth stating: it removes only keys the query
already ignores. `prune_preserves_derivedHeads` is that statement, and it is
conditional on `isSuperseded`, so a sweep that removed a live head would not
satisfy it.

`prune_markersOnly_resurrects` is the matching non-vacuity result: removing a
head's markers while leaving its head key makes it read as a head again. That is
why the two deletions belong to one transaction, and it is the case
`proofs/tla/MC_HeadSet_Red_MarkersOnly.cfg` fails on. -/

/-- Reclaim `b`: drop its head key and every marker against it. -/
def applyPrune (s : Store) (b : BlockId) : Store :=
  { headKeys := s.headKeys.filter (fun h => h != b)

    supersedes := s.supersedes.filter (fun q => q.1 != b) }

marker it removes names `b`, and no other head is asking about those. -/
