---- MODULE HeadSet ----
\* Concurrent collection-head transitions, abstracting
\* crates/db/src/block/builder/collection.rs (write_collection_block) over the
\* regolith-backed store in crates/storage/src/backends/regolith.
\*
\* THE MECHANISM. A collection's head set is the set of blocks in its DAG that no
\* other block names as a parent. `write_collection_block` maintains it by:
\*   1. scanning the head prefix to read the current heads (collection.rs:27-53),
\*   2. writing a new block whose parents are exactly those heads (:73),
\*   3. writing the new head key (:91),
\*   4. DELETING every old head key it observed (:96-100).
\*
\* Step 4 is the whole subject of this model. Two transactions that run
\* concurrently both observe the same old head and both delete it. That is a
\* write-write conflict on ONE key, and regolith validates the write set at every
\* isolation level, so the second transaction aborts. Relaxing isolation does not
\* help: the failure is identical under ReadCommitted, SnapshotIsolation and
\* Serializable, because none of them permit two transactions to write the same
\* key concurrently.
\*
\* WHAT THE OLD BACKEND DID. The store that regolith replaced carried its own
\* conflict tracker with a carve-out: `IterOptions::with_commutative_set` marked
\* a prefix scan as an observed-remove/add set transition, and the tracker then
\* PERMITTED overlapping keys when both transactions marked the scan that way.
\* regolith has no such notion, so the carve-out had no equivalent and the
\* conflict became real. The flag has since been removed rather than kept as a
\* no-op.
\*
\* WHY THIS MATTERS. Forming sibling heads from concurrent writes is not an
\* optimization, it is what makes the structure a CRDT: two writers that did not
\* see each other must both land and leave two tips for a later merge to join.
\* A model where one of them aborts has changed the data structure's semantics,
\* not merely its throughput.
\*
\* ONE KNOB:
\*   Strategy = "EagerDelete" - the tree as it stands: a writer deletes every head
\*                              it observed. Two concurrent writers write the same
\*                              delete, so one aborts.                      [RED]
\*            = "Derived"     - a writer only ever writes keys derived from its OWN
\*                              block id: its head key, and one supersede marker
\*                              per parent naming itself as the superseder. Write
\*                              sets are disjoint by construction, so nothing can
\*                              conflict. The head set is then DERIVED (a stored
\*                              head is a head iff nothing supersedes it) rather
\*                              than maintained by deletion.                [GREEN]
\*
\* The point of running both is that GREEN alone would not show the fix is
\* load-bearing. RED under EagerDelete is what proves the conflict is real and
\* that the derived model is what removes it.
\*
\* A SECOND KNOB, for the reclamation the derived strategy makes necessary.
\* Nothing deletes a superseded head key on the write path any more, so without
\* a sweep the headstore grows one key per mutation and every append scans all
\* of them. `Prune` is that sweep. It runs in a transaction of its own, which is
\* why it takes no part in WriteSet: folding it into an append would put back
\* the shared write the derived strategy exists to remove.
\*
\*   Reclaim = "Together"    - a head key and every marker against it leave in
\*                             one transaction, so the query can never observe
\*                             one without the other.                     [GREEN]
\*           = "MarkersOnly" - the markers go and the head key stays. The head
\*                             they superseded reads as live again and the head
\*                             set stops matching the DAG.
\*                             INV_HeadsExact fails.                      [RED]
\*
\* The second pair exists for the same reason as the first: "they leave
\* together" is a claim, and a claim has to be able to fail.
\*
\* A THIRD KNOB, for what the engine records about the head scan. regolith
\* 0.1.6 made `Serializable` validate every key a transactional scan yields.
\* The head scan yields the superseded head keys and markers the sweep
\* deletes, so a sweep committing under an open append aborted the append at
\* commit, although the live set the append derived from that scan was
\* unchanged. The abort is spurious, and it inverts the design: the sweep is
\* the side that is meant to lose. `RepeatableRead` is the regolith level for this
\* read: a point read is validated as at `Serializable`, a scan is recorded
\* per stretch and never per key. DefraDB runs its store at `RepeatableRead`.
\*
\*   ScanReads = "Stretch" - RepeatableRead: what a scan walked is not in the read
\*                           set, so a sweep cannot abort an append.  [GREEN]
\*             = "PerKey"  - Serializable since regolith 0.1.6: every key the
\*                           scan yielded is validated, so a sweep that
\*                           reclaims one of them after the append's snapshot
\*                           aborts the append. INV_NoWriteConflict fails.
\*                                                                     [RED]

\* Key space. A key is modeled as a string tag paired with the block it names,
\* which is all the conflict check needs: two writes conflict iff they name the
\* same key.

HeadKey(b)          == <<"head", b, b>>
SupersedeKey(p, c)  == <<"supersede", p, c>>
DeleteKey(b)        == <<"head", b, b>>   \* a delete writes the same key it removes

\* The set of keys a writer w commits, given what it observed.
WriteSet(w) ==
  IF Strategy = "EagerDelete"
    THEN {HeadKey(w)} \cup {DeleteKey(h) : h \in observed[w]}
    \* Every key here is a function of w, the writer's own block id, so two
    \* distinct writers cannot produce the same key. That is the whole fix.
    ELSE {HeadKey(w)} \cup {SupersedeKey(h, w) : h \in observed[w]}

\* Keys already written by a committed transaction.
CommittedKeys == {k \in {HeadKey(b) : b \in Blocks}
                    \cup {SupersedeKey(p, c) : <<p, c>> \in Blocks \X Blocks}

                  \E w \in committed : k \in WriteSet(w)}

\* regolith validates the write set at commit: a transaction aborts if any key it
\* writes was written by a transaction that committed after its snapshot. Both
\* writers snapshot before either commits, so "since its snapshot" is simply
\* "by anyone already committed".
\*
\* Under PerKey the head keys the writer's scan yielded are validated too, and
\* a sweep that reclaimed one of them is a write to a key in the read set. Every
\* key in walked[w] was stored at the snapshot and a block is never stored
\* twice, so any of them in `pruned` was reclaimed after the snapshot.
