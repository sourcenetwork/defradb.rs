"""Compare two run documents and decide what actually regressed.

The hard part is not computing a percentage, it is refusing to report one that
means nothing. A run recorded while the host was busy can shift a figure by a
quarter with no code change, so a comparison that treats every delta as signal
produces alerts nobody trusts, and an alert nobody trusts is worse than none.

Three rules keep a verdict honest:

* **Both sides must be trusted.** If either run marked a family
  ``contaminated`` or ``absent``, the comparison is reported as ``unverified``
  and never as a pass or a regression.
* **Ranges must separate.** A row carries the ``min`` and ``max`` seen across
  repetitions. A delta counts only when the two ranges do not overlap: if the
  new ``max`` still reaches the old ``min``, the runs did not measure a
  difference, whatever their medians say. A row without a range skips this
  test, which is correct for a deterministic count and is why a bench that
  repeats a timing should always report one.
* **A floor on top of that.** Non-overlapping ranges can still be a fraction of
  a percent apart. A change within plus or minus ``--threshold`` percent is
  acceptable and reported as noise regardless, so at the default only a move of
  more than 5% either way is called a regression or an improvement.

Comparisons are per platform. A metric measured on Linux is not a baseline for
the same metric measured in a browser, and pretending otherwise would produce a
regression report on every run.
